Discord Rich Presence for Android by sending app to PC!

How to setup?

Download the apk from releases

Download the server executable, start the server executable

get ur local ip address on pc (might be different if u use ethernet on it or mobile data/usb tethering)

open the android app, start accessibility service, put the local ip in text box and click select

swipe apps to confirm if rpc works, if it doesn't then u probs used a wrong ip lolz


if u wish to use this from anywhere/not same network then use zerotier


this probs need more work later but busy rn


Is this against tos?
no, it doesn't modify client nor selfbot, it uses discord's game sdk thing
