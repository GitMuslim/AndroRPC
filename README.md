<p align="center">Discord Rich Presence for Android by sending app details to PC!</p>

<H1 align="center">How to setup?</H1>

Download the apk & server executable from [releases](https://github.com/mustafakhalaf-git/AndroRPC/releases)

Start the server executable (use command line for debugging if data sending works)

Get your Local IP Address on PC (might be different if you use ethernet on it or mobile data/usb tethering)

Open the android app, start accessibility service, put the local ip in text box and click select

Swipe between apps to confirm if RPC is working, if it doesn't then you probably used a wrong IP or need to disable firewall

If you wish to use this from anywhere (not same network) then use [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/)

~~this probs need more work later but busy rn~~


Is this against [Discord's ToS](https://discord.com/terms)?
No, it doesn't modify client nor self-bot, it uses Discord's Game SDK PC version, the phone only sends app details to PC

<H1 align="center">TODO</H1>

~~* Add greater instructions~~ [Done](https://github.com/mustafakhalaf-git/AndroRPC/wiki/How-to-setup)
* Possibly publish on F-Droid
~~* New logo~~ nvm this one gud
* More features later on
