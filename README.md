How to setup?

Download the apk from releases

Download the server executable, start the server executable

get ur local ip address on pc (might be different if u use ethernet on it or mobile data/usb tethering)

open the android app, start accessibility service, put the local ip in text box and click select

swipe apps to confirm if rpc works, if it doesn't then u probs used a wrong ip lolz


if u wish to use this from anywhere/not same network then use zerotier
